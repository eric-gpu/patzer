## Why Patzer

- **Your games stay home.** Single Docker container on a Pi / NAS / old laptop. No cloud, no telemetry, no upsell.
- **Bring your own LLM.** The AI coach runs against your own [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) host. The coach is render-only — chess facts are computed server-side by Stockfish + chess.js, so a small local model can't hallucinate moves or pieces.
- **Made for a household, not a stadium.** Multi-user with admin console, per-profile language, kid-mode blunder warnings, "horsey" piece names for the youngest profiles.

## What it is

Patzer is a tiny, self-hosted take on the Chess.com / Lichess workflow you actually use:

- **Game Review** — pull your public Chess.com or Lichess games (or paste a PGN; Chess.com games can sync on their own), analyze with bundled Stockfish, get chess.com-style classifications (Brilliant / Great / Best / Excellent / Good / Book / Inaccuracy / Mistake / Miss / Blunder), accuracy %, estimated Elo, eval graph, key moments, top engine lines, a "What's the threat?" probe, and master-game statistics for the position.
- **Play vs Bot** — full games against Stockfish at seven named tiers (Kid → Stockfish max), all standard time controls, a queue of up to six premoves shown on the board, kid-mode blunder warnings.
- **Play vs Friend** — real-time PvP between profiles on the same server over WebSocket, with draw offers, takebacks and one-click rematch. Playing across the internet is a tunnel away — see the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#can-i-play-a-friend-who-lives-somewhere-else).
- **Players & profiles** — a directory of everyone on your server with a rating leaderboard, live presence and public profiles (record, per-time-class ratings, your head-to-head), challenge-from-profile, and a "missed invitations" rail.
- **AI Coach (your LLM)** — point at any [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) host (or, if you have no GPU to spare, the hosted DeepSeek API). Audience-tuned voices for Kid / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced. Anti-hallucination by design — chess facts are computed server-side; the LLM only renders them.
- **Family-ready** — multi-user with admin console, open / invite-only / closed sign-up, per-profile language, kid-mode blunder warnings, "horsey" piece names for the youngest profiles.
- **Opening trainer** — drill 16 built-in main lines or any line from your own repertoire; the moves you miss come back in a daily review queue.
- **Multilingual** — English, Bulgarian, Spanish and German out of the box, UI *and* coach prompts. Adding a language is one table entry per file — see CONTRIBUTING.
- **Self-hosted, single container** — runs on a Pi, a NAS, an old laptop. Your games never leave home.
- **Phone-friendly** — full-width board, sticky action bar and a swipe-up move list on small screens.
- **Tells you when it's stale** — a self-hosted app can't update itself, but Patzer checks GitHub every six hours and shows a one-line notice when a newer release is out, so you know to pull. Sends nothing about you; switch it off in *Admin → System*.

## First run in five minutes

Pick **one** of these. The Docker options open <http://localhost:8800>; the Codespaces option opens in your browser. Either way, the first visit walks you through a setup wizard.

**Try it in your browser**

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/SikamikanikoBG/patzer?quickstart=1)

Spins up a temporary Codespace with Patzer + Stockfish pre-installed. Wait ~60 seconds for `npm install` + dev server to start, then click the forwarded port labelled *"Patzer (Vite dev — open this)"*. You get the full app **except** the AI Coach narration (which needs an Ollama host on your network — see below).

**`docker run`**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8800:8800 \
  -v patzer-data:/app/data \
  --name patzer \
  ghcr.io/SikamikanikoBG/patzer:latest
```

**`docker compose`**

```yaml
services:
  patzer:
    image: ghcr.io/SikamikanikoBG/patzer:latest
    container_name: patzer
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8800:8800"
    volumes:
      - patzer-data:/app/data
volumes:
  patzer-data:
```

> **What works without any extras:** play vs Stockfish, play vs friend on the same server,
> move classification, accuracy %, eval graph, opening detection. The setup wizard takes you
> straight to a working board.
>
> **What needs an LLM:** the AI Coach commentary voice. Until you point Patzer at an Ollama or
> vLLM host, the *Coach* panel just shows the engine facts in plain text.
>
> **What needs a Chess.com or Lichess username:** importing your public games for review. Without it
> you can still load PGNs by paste or play live and review from the move list.

You'll want, optionally:

- **For the AI Coach:** an [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) server reachable from the Patzer container (pick the provider in *Admin → System*). The wizard validates the URL and lists available models for you. Patzer accepts loopback / RFC1918 / `*.local` / `host.docker.internal` Ollama hosts only — public-Internet model proxies aren't supported here. The one hosted exception is DeepSeek, which you opt into with an API key in *Admin → System*.
- **For Game Review on your own games:** a Chess.com and/or Lichess username (entered later in *Settings*).

To use a different host port, run with `-p 9000:8800` (or set `HOST_PORT=9000` if you're using `docker compose`).

If you're terminating TLS at a reverse proxy, set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in the container's environment so session cookies aren't shipped over plaintext HTTP.

## How it's built

<p align="center">

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/diagrams/architecture-dark.svg">
    <img src="docs/diagrams/architecture-light.svg" width="960" alt="Architecture: your browser talks HTTPS/WebSocket to one Docker container running a Hono server, native Stockfish and SQLite; an Ollama or vLLM host on your LAN and Chess.com/Lichess are optional, outside the container"/>
  </picture>
</p>

The coach is render-only: every prompt is built from a pre-computed fact list (piece inventory, captured pieces, recent moves in plain English, in-check flag, engine PV) and the LLM is forbidden from inventing moves or pieces. See [server/src/coach/prompts.ts](server/src/coach/prompts.ts) and the [CHANGELOG 2.1.0 entry](CHANGELOG.md) for the why. Because the model only phrases what it is handed, `gemma3:1b` on a CPU is enough for a readable coach.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js ≥ 20.11.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SikamikanikoBG/patzer.git
cd patzer
npm install
npm run setup   # downloads Stockfish 17 into ./bin/ (Windows, Linux, macOS)
npm run dev
```

- Server: <http://localhost:8800>
- Vite dev server (HMR): <http://localhost:5173> — proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the server.

`npm run setup` dispatches to `setup.ps1` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) and picks the official
build for your CPU; on an older x86 CPU without AVX2 run `STOCKFISH_ASSET=stockfish-ubuntu-x86-64-sse41-popcnt npm run setup`.
A package-manager Stockfish (`apt install stockfish` / `brew install stockfish`) works too — the server
also looks in `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/games`.

Useful scripts:

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc -b across server + web + tests (no emit)
npm test            # vitest — classifier, Glicko, PGN round-trip, explorer, PvP helpers
npm run test:e2e    # boots a real server on a scratch DB and plays a PvP game over two sockets
npm run build       # production build of both workspaces
```

## Deploying to a home server

The published image plus the `docker compose` snippet above is all most people need — add the
[Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) label and your box tracks releases by itself.
If you'd rather build from source on the target, two equivalent scripts are bundled — `deploy.ps1` for Windows hosts,
`deploy.sh` for Linux / macOS hosts. Both tar the source, scp it to the
target, then run `docker compose build && up -d` over SSH.

Create `.env.deploy` (gitignored) on the workstation you're deploying *from*:

```
HOST=user@192.168.x.x
REMOTE_DIR=/home/user/patzer
SUDO_PASS=... # only if your user is not in the docker group on the target
HOST_PORT=8800
```

Then:

```powershell
# Windows
.\deploy.ps1            # tar source → ssh, build & start
.\deploy.ps1 -NoBuild   # restart without rebuilding
.\deploy.ps1 -Logs      # tail logs after deploy
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./deploy.sh             # tar source → ssh, build & start
./deploy.sh --no-build  # restart without rebuilding
./deploy.sh --logs      # tail logs after deploy
```

## Configuration

All user-facing configuration is done **through the UI** and persisted in SQLite. The only environment variables are operational:

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8800` | HTTP listen port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/chess.db` | SQLite database file |
| `STOCKFISH_PATH` | (auto) | Override Stockfish binary path |
| `LICHESS_EXPLORER_URL` | `https://explorer.lichess.ovh` | Opening-explorer upstream for the *Master games* panel (a self-hosted `lila-openingexplorer` works) |
| `UPDATE_CHECK` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable the six-hourly "a newer release exists" check for the whole deployment (there's also a toggle in *Admin → System*) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | (auto-generated) | Cookie signing secret. Persisted on first run. |
| `COOKIE_SECURE`  | `false` | Set to `true` when terminating TLS at a reverse proxy so session cookies are flagged `Secure`. |
| `ENGINE_BACKEND` | `local` | `chessapi` sends Game Review positions to the hosted chess-api.com engine instead of the bundled Stockfish (opt-in — for a Pi or a public demo instance) |
| `CHESSCOM_SYNC_MINUTES` | `15` | How often linked Chess.com accounts are synced, analyzed and reviewed in the background; `0` turns the timer off |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | (none) | DeepSeek key for the coach; wins over the key saved in *Admin → System* (handy with Docker secrets) |

System settings (coach provider and model, Stockfish path override, who can sign up) live in *Admin → System*; invites in *Admin → Users*.
Per-profile settings (language, audience, coach behavior, TTS voice, sound sets, Chess.com / Lichess usernames) live in *Settings*.

## How move classification works

Each played move is compared against the engine's best move at the same position. We compute the **win-percentage drop** using the Lichess sigmoid (`50 + 50 · (2 / (1 + exp(-0.00368208 · cp)) − 1)`) and combine it with real centipawn loss as a guard against lopsided positions:

| Classification | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Best ★ | the engine's #1 move |
| Excellent ✓ | win-% drop < 2 **and** cp loss < 50 |
| Good · | win-% drop < 5 **and** cp loss < 100 |
| Inaccuracy ?! | win-% drop < 10 |
| Mistake ? | win-% drop < 20 |
| Blunder ?? | win-% drop ≥ 20 |

On top of that ladder: **Forced** (only one legal move) and **Book** (the position is in the bundled ECO table) replace the label; **Brilliant** `!!` is the engine's #1 move that leaves ≥ a minor piece en prise — measured with a static exchange evaluation, net of what the move captured — in a position that isn't already crushing, where the engine line doesn't just win the material back; **Great** `!` is the engine's #1 when the second-best move is ≥ 200 cp worse, or a move that lifts a lost position back to equal; **Miss** flags a mistake-or-worse that threw away a clearly winning eval or a forced mate. Same-sign mate transitions (+M3 → +M2) cost nothing. Per-game accuracy is the Lichess formula `103.1668 · exp(-0.04354 · Δwin%) − 3.1669`, clamped to `[0, 100]`, excluding book and forced moves.

Estimated Elo comes from average centipawn loss on a piecewise curve calibrated against chess.com Game Review (ACPL 8 → 2700, 18 → 2200, 25 → 1900, 35 → 1600, 50 → 1400, 70 → 1200, 100 → 900, 150 → 600), with accuracy nudging it ±20 Elo at most. The per-game *performance rating* additionally blends in the opponent's rating, weighted by how settled that rating is. All of this is unit-tested — see `server/test/classifier.test.ts`.

## Tech

- **Server:** Node 20 · TypeScript · [Hono](https://hono.dev) · [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) · [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) · `ws` · native [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)
- **Web:** React 18 · Vite · Tailwind CSS · [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) · framer-motion · react-i18next · TanStack Query
- **Coach:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) (default model: `gemma3:1b`; something like `qwen2.5:7b` gives a nicer voice)
- **Tests:** [vitest](https://vitest.dev) unit suites + an end-to-end PvP run against a real server
- **TTS:** browser Web Speech API (uses installed OS voices)
- **Persistence:** single SQLite file in `./data/`

## Troubleshooting

- **"Stockfish binary not found"** — Patzer no longer falls back to a bare `stockfish` PATH lookup (defense-in-depth: a malicious binary earlier in `$PATH` would otherwise run as the server user). Either install Stockfish into `/usr/games/stockfish`, `/usr/local/bin/stockfish`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/stockfish`, or `bin/stockfish` in the project, or set `STOCKFISH_PATH` (env) / *Admin → System → Stockfish path*.
- **"Ollama unreachable" / "fetch failed"** — inside Docker, `localhost` is the Patzer container itself, not your computer. Two things have to line up:
  1. **Ollama listens on the network.** By default it only answers on its own machine's loopback. Set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` (Windows: a user environment variable, then quit and restart Ollama from the tray; Linux: `sudo systemctl edit ollama` → `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"`, then restart the service).
  2. **Patzer uses an address that reaches it.** Same machine: `http://host.docker.internal:11434` — built into Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac; on Linux uncomment the `extra_hosts` lines in `docker-compose.yml`, or add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to `docker run`. Another machine: its LAN IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:11434`.

  The setup wizard and *Admin → System* show this hint when the test fails. The setup-time test only allows loopback / RFC1918 / `*.local` / `host.docker.internal` URLs. After setup, change it any time in *Admin → System*.
- **Port 8800 already in use** — `-p 9000:8800` (docker run) or `HOST_PORT=9000 docker compose up -d`.
- **Lost your admin password** — there is no in-app reset yet. Until one ships, edit `chess.db` directly: open `data/chess.db` with `sqlite3` and replace the row's `password_hash` with a `bcryptjs` hash (cost ≥ 12).
- **Cookies dropped behind a reverse proxy** — see `COOKIE_SECURE=true` above. The cookie also requires the same hostname for both the page and the API.
